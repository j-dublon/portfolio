          I currently work as a Product Developer for a digital consultancy that builds 
          technical capabilities while delivering industry-leading digital 
          strategies and products. I am currently working with a national media company to 
          deliver a React Native app used by 8 million+ people. In this role I have led on 
          project-critical features, delivered training in React Native and TDD, and 
          worked closely with our client's devs to build their skills and confidence. As well
          as my client work, I also mentor more junior developers, and support our in-house 
          communities of practice.<br />
          <br />Prior to this, I worked as a Mobile App Developer for an industry-leading
          agency in York. I worked primarily in React Native and GraphQL, using
          modular programming to produce robust, maintainable code. I was
          involved in every stage of the development life cycle, from
          problem-analysis to deployment, working closely with designers
          and testers to ensure every product exceeded clientsâ€™ expectations.<br />
          <br />I thrive in challenging environments and I am always keen to learn new tech 
          stacks. I am currently teaching myself Python.
