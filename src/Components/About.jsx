      <h2>About me</h2>
      <p>
        Prior to completing the Northcoders Developer Pathway in 2020, I worked
        in international development; I have two MSc. degrees from Technische
        Universit√§t Dresden, Germany, and Copenhagen University, Denmark.
        Between 2014 and 2016, I provided communications, administration and
        monitoring and evaluation support to a global flood resilience programme
        at the international NGO Practical Action. After spending some time
        volunteering abroad, I started and ran a successful business growing and
        supplying organic vegetables to retailers in Hebden Bridge and
        Todmorden.
